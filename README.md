OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project : Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

Objective:
The objective of this task is to build a linear regression model to predict passenger fares based on the Titanic dataset.
The focus is on training a machine learning model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the relationship between age and fare.

Key Activities:

Feature Selection: Selected the relevant feature (age) and target variable (fare) for the model.
Model Training: Trained a linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared metrics.
Technologies Used:

Python: Used for data preprocessing and machine learning.
scikit-learn: Employed for building the linear regression model.
matplotlib: Used for visualizing the modelâ€™s predictions.
